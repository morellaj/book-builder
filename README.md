# Online Book Builder
This is an online book builder that will be used to create the books for LearningistheSolution.com.  It will function similar to PowerPoint, allowing us to create books visually.  The books will be exported as JSON files, which will serve as instructions for the website to create React components.

# Why create this?
Currently the books on LearningistheSolution.com are PDFs.  Moving to JSON format will decrease download times, increase book flexibility, and reduce time needed to update books.

Also it's an interesting idea I had and I want to build it!
